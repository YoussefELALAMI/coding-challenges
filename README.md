## 📌 About This Repository
This repository contains my step-by-step solutions to various algorithmic and data structure problems from **LeetCode**.

## 🚀 How I Work on Problems
1. **Pick a problem** from LeetCode (sometimes random, sometimes topic-focused).
2. **Understand the problem statement** and constraints.
3. **Plan an approach** (brute force → optimized solution).
4. **Implement** the solution in **Java** or **Pyhton** (primary language).
5. **Analyze complexity** (time & space).
6. **Push automatically** to GitHub via LeetHub.
